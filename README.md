## What is Metamaps?

Metamaps is a free and open-source technology for changemakers, innovators, educators and students. It enables individuals and communities to build and visualize their shared knowledge and unlock their collective intelligence.

You can find a version of this software running at [metamaps.cc][site-beta], where the technology is being tested in an open beta.

Metamaps is developed and maintained by a distributed, nomadic community comprised of technologists, artists and storytellers. You can get in touch by using whichever of these channels you prefer:

## Installation for local use or development of Metamaps

First off is getting the code downloaded to your computer. You can download a zip file from github, but if you've got `git` you can just run `git clone https://github.com/metamaps/metamaps` in your terminal.

You have ability to use the instructions for setup on various platforms!

Mac and Ubuntu ? 
Of course, we have particular support for any case-platforms also here is how for Mac and Ubuntu:
- [Mac Install Walkthrough][mac-installation]
- [Ubuntu Install Walkthrough][ubuntu-installation]

If you prefer to isolate your install in a virtual machine, you may find it simpler to setup using Vagrant:
- [Vagrant installation][vagrant-installation]

We don't promise support for Windows, but at one point we had it running and we've kept those docs available for reference
- [Outdated Windows Walkthrough][windows-installation]
