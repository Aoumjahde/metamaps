```

cd metamaps

./bin/configure.sh

```

This will do all the setup steps to make Metamaps work with a bit of behind the scenes ninja magick.



To start servers which will run metamaps you can then run:

```

./bin/start

```

To stop them:

```

./bin/stop

```

With your webservers running, open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
